# RandomCodeMusings
This GitHub is dedicated to my ongoing learning in automation through coding.
Specifically, I'll be focusing on automation through Bash at first.
As time goes on, and my comfort in Bash grows, I will be expanding to (most likely) GoLang and PowerShell.

Please feel free to review, pull, or comment on any projects posted.
I'm always open to constructive criticism, and look forward to hearing from you!
